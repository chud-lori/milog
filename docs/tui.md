# TUI — `milog tui`

A richer bubbletea-based TUI that runs alongside the existing bash
`milog monitor`. Same data source (system /proc readers + nginx log
tail), different render path.

## When to pick which

| Want                                            | Use               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Works on any POSIX shell with no extra binary   | `milog monitor`   |
| Richer layout, nicer colors, built-in help pane | `milog tui`       |
| Script-wrap or embed in a pager                 | `milog monitor`   |
| A TUI you can ship in a terminal-first dev loop | `milog tui`       |

Both pull the same numbers — if they disagree, that's a bug.

## Install

`milog tui` ships as a Go binary (`milog-tui`). The standard
curl-pipe installer downloads it automatically from the matching
GitHub Release — no Go toolchain on your server.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chud-lori/milog/main/install.sh \
  | sudo bash
```

On a host with a published release for your arch, the installer prints
`Installed milog-tui → /usr/local/bin/milog-tui (from vX.Y.Z)` and
you're done.

If no release is published yet for your arch (or at all), the
installer prints `prebuilt binaries: no matching asset … — skipping`
and only the bash `milog.sh` lands. `milog monitor` still works;
`milog tui` prints an install hint.

**Pinning to a specific release** (useful for CI / reproducible
deploys): `MILOG_RELEASE_TAG=v0.3.2 curl … install.sh | sudo bash`.

**Contributor path** (cloning + building locally): `bash build.sh`
produces `go/bin/milog-tui`. Re-running `sudo ./install.sh` from the
clone picks those up instead of downloading — clone wins over Release
so contributor builds stay authoritative.

## Binary lookup order

`milog tui` looks for the binary in this order (first match wins):

- `$MILOG_TUI_BIN` (explicit override)
- `/usr/local/libexec/milog/milog-tui` (future package layout)
- `/usr/local/bin/milog-tui` ← where path 1 / 2 install it
- `go/bin/milog-tui` (dev layout, relative to the script)

If none are present, the "not installed" hint points at this page.

## Run it

```bash
milog tui
# or invoke the binary directly:
milog-tui
```

Keys (inside the TUI):

| Key                      | Action                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C`           | quit                                                                  |
| `p`                      | pause (freeze sparklines + numbers)                                   |
| `r`                      | refresh now (bypasses the tick)                                       |
| `+` / `=`                | faster refresh (down to 1s)                                           |
| `-` / `_`                | slower refresh (up to 60s)                                            |
| `?`                      | toggle help pane                                                      |
| `↑` / `k`, `↓` / `j`     | move row cursor in overview                                           |
| `enter` / `l` / `→`      | drill into the highlighted app — top paths, top IPs, recent alerts    |
| `esc` / `h` / `←` / `bs` | back to overview from any drill-down or named view                    |
| `a`                      | global alerts view (last 24h, newest first, capped at 50)             |
| `P`                      | paths-cross-app view (top 12 paths summed across apps + breakdown)    |
| `e`                      | errors view (`app:*` rule fires aggregated by pattern → source)       |
| `t`                      | trend view (per-app 60-minute request-rate sparklines from history DB) |

## Config

All settings come from the same env vars / config keys the bash side
uses — no separate TUI config:

| Env var         | Default          | Purpose                           |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `MILOG_APPS`    | auto-discover    | space-separated app names         |
| `MILOG_LOG_DIR` | `/var/log/nginx` | nginx access-log directory        |
| `MILOG_REFRESH` | `5`              | default seconds between ticks     |

So `milog config set REFRESH 3` changes both `milog monitor` and
`milog tui`.

## Non-TTY usage

For CI / packaging scripts, the binary has two non-TTY paths:

```bash
milog-tui --version    # prints "milog-tui v=<sha>" and exits
milog-tui --help       # prints keybinds + env vars and exits
```

Actual TUI rendering needs a real terminal (bubbletea relies on
raw-mode input + altscreen).

## Why `tui` AND `monitor`?

Per the project's bash-and-Go cohabitation rule: anything bash already
does well stays bash. `milog monitor` stays the default and always
will — it works on any POSIX host with zero extra install. `milog tui`
is the richer option for contributors / ops who already have the Go
binary installed (or want to build it).
